# rainmeter-weekly-chore-skin

A little custom rainmeter skin to give me checkboxes for my weekly chores. Chores can be added to a specific day of the week, or can be 'everyday' tasks. They are then listed as a little todo list every day.

Right now chores have to be set within the script.lua file, but I'll be moving that to a separate config file soon. Checkboxes also do not stay checked on reload for simplicity, but I'd like to add a better way to keep track of which chores have been completed. Better styling may also be incoming, but no promises

Do with this what you will
