A little custom rainmeter skin to give me checkboxes for my weekly chores. Chores can be added to a specific day of the week, or can be 'everyday' tasks. They are then listed as a little todo list every day.

Right now chores have to be set within the script.lua file, but I'll be moving that to a separate config file soon. In the meantime, it's very easy to edit, even if you have no programming knowledge. Just open script.lua in any text editor and adjust the entries of taskTable for each day.

Checkboxes also do not stay checked on reload for simplicity, but I'd like to add a better way to keep track of which chores have been completed. Better styling may also be incoming, but no promises.

Do with this what you will. Cheers
